Introduction

This project uses Data Science and Machine Learning to analyze data, find useful patterns, and build predictive models. By following the complete ML workflow—data collection, cleaning, exploration, model training, and evaluation—the project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights. The goal is to solve a real-world problem using modern algorithms and practical data-driven techniques.
